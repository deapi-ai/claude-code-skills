# OCR (Image to Text) via deAPI

Extract text from image: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Step 1: Validate input

Verify `$ARGUMENTS` is a valid image URL:
- Supported formats: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`, `.gif`, `.bmp`
- URL must be publicly accessible

## Step 2: Send request

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://api.deapi.ai/api/v1/client/img2txt" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEAPI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "image_url": "$ARGUMENTS",
    "model": "Nanonets_Ocr_S_F16"
  }'
```

## Step 3: Poll status (feedback loop)

Extract `request_id` from response, then poll every 10 seconds:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.deapi.ai/api/v1/client/request-status/{request_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEAPI_API_KEY"
```

**Status handling:**
- `processing` → wait 10s, poll again
- `done` → proceed to Step 4
- `failed` → report error message to user, STOP

## Step 4: Fetch and present result

When `status = "done"`:
1. Get extracted text from response or `result_url`
2. Present text in clean, formatted manner
3. Preserve original structure (paragraphs, lists) where possible

## Step 5: Offer follow-up

Ask user:
- "Would you like me to summarize this text?"
- "Should I translate this to another language?"
- "Would you like to extract text from another image?"

## Error handling
